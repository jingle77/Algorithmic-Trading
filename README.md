# Algorithmic Trading
A collection of trading algorithms, expert advisors (for MT5), and notebooks that I utilize to trade and research stocks, options, FOREX, and cryptocurrencies

## Table of Contents

- ### Expert Advisors
  - [My first Expert Advisor](https://github.com/jingle77/Algorithmic-Trading/blob/main/Expert%20Advisors/My_First_EA.mq5): An extremely simple expert advisor that opens a trade during a specified hour and closes it on another specified hour.
  
  - [SMA Crossover](https://github.com/jingle77/Algorithmic-Trading/blob/main/Expert%20Advisors/MA_Crossover.mq5): A simple moving average crossover expert advisor. Trades are open when a "fast" moving average crosses a "slow" moving average.

- ### Trading Signals
  - [XGB SPY Classifier: Will SPY close higher or lower tomorrow?](https://github.com/jingle77/Algorithmic-Trading/blob/main/Trading%20Signals/SPY_STRAT_UP_OR_DOWN.ipynb): A trading signal built with RSI and SMA indicators in combination with an XGboost classifier that indicates whether or not the next day close price of SPY will be higher than the open price.
